####Commit [b4e87fbc](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/b4e87fbc9a841fa383fa84fe1992c930d8f835b1)

Here we go!  The `Get-StringToken` function is in the [StringTokens.psm1](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/blob/b4e87fbc9a841fa383fa84fe1992c930d8f835b1/StringTokens.psm1) script module, and [Tester.ps1](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/blob/b4e87fbc9a841fa383fa84fe1992c930d8f835b1/Tester.ps1) (if you can even call that a "test") is demonstration code which was copied and pasted pretty much verbatim onto the TechNet Script Gallery page where this code was uploaded.  Initial observations:

- Tester.ps1 has to go.  It's going to be replaced with a proper suite of unit tests using Pester.  For this, I'll be using the latest Beta version of Pester v3 (currently available from https://github.com/pester/Pester/tree/Beta).  If Pester v3 is released by the time this refactoring log is finished, that link will have changed.
- `Get-StringToken` itself is a single function around 350 lines long, 300 if you ignore the comment-based help.  Once we understand everything that it does and have a suite of tests to ensure its behavior remains consistent, we'll start to break that code up into much smaller, easy to understand functions.
- One thing that the current version of `Get-StringToken` has going for it are comments next to many of the conditional statements.  These will help in understanding what the heck is going in in this 300-line blob of code, but eventually, we're going to get rid of those comments and replace them with code that is so easy to take in at a glance, it doesn't need to be commented anyway.

Before making any changes to the existing code, I want to have a complete suite of unit tests documenting and verifying its behavior.  I started by reading the Comment-Based Help of `Get-StringToken` and by reading the existing Tester.ps1 script.  While these were not automated tests, they still had valuable example code and documentation of what each parameter of `Get-StringToken` was supposed to accomplish.

Based on this documented behavior, I was able to determine that if you only pass in a string (or array of strings) to Get-StringToken, it should have the following behavior:

- Strings are delimited by tabs and spaces (in addition to line endings)
- Consecutive delimiters should produce an empty token in between each pair.
- Tokens can contain delimiters if they are surrounded with a pair of double quotes.
- If a token does not begin with a double quote, any double quote characters found within the token are just treated as literals.
- Inside a quoted string, you can embed a literal quotation mark by placing two consecutive quotation marks.
- Quoted tokens cannot contain multiple lines.
 
You can see the first few Pester tests in [StringTokens.Tests.ps1](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/blob/d6f865b19de7006414d2ad9fec6798c3eaad54fb/StringTokens.Tests.ps1).  To execute these tests, I use the `Invoke-Pester` command, producing the following output:

```posh

```

I may think of other tests for this "default behavior" context as time goes on, but for now, it's a good start.  Next steps:  look more closely at each of the other parameters to Get-StringToken, and write more tests which verify the output when they're used.  Note that I'm not touching the ugly code at all yet.  I'm not going to do that until I have a complete suite of tests for all of the code.  Speaking of which, here's how I can use Pester's code coverage analysis feature (new to the v3.0 beta) to get an idea of how much progress I'm making:

```posh
Invoke-Pester -CodeCoverage .\StringTokens.psm1

<#
... Normal test output, as above.

64 percent... not too bad, considering I haven't tested any of the optional parameters to the function yet.  Keep in mind, though, that this just tells me how much code in the module was _executed_ during the tests; it's no guarantee that I've actually written enough assertions to consider all of that code _tested_.

#### Commit [87c85c1b](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/87c85c1b8c1e7ac98f093d364a9277476cb0b290#diff-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e) - Testing the `-Escape` parameter

Starting to write tests around each of the optional parameters; I picked `-Escape` as the lucky first contestant.  According to the documentation, examples, and what dim memory I have of writing this code, I gave the user a couple of options for passing in the list of escape characters.  You could choose to pass in an array (e.g.: `-Escape @('\', '#')`), or a single string containing the characters (or whatever combination of the two.)  Why I felt this was a good idea at the time, I don't know, but now it's part of the public API, and that's how it will stay.  It just means there's more behavior to test.

I also realized that in the "default behavior" tests, I hadn't verified that no characters work as escape characters, other than doubling up the qualifier (quote).  I added a test for this, but it was very slow to run at first (using a full set of 0..65535 for the characters to test), so I limited it to just the basic ASCII range of 0..127.

Not much difference in the code coverage metrics from this; up about another 2% to 66.35.

Not much to see here.  Tests are just about identical to those for the `-Escape` parameter, as `-Delimiter` allows the same options of passing by array or in a single string.  Code coverage remains the same at 66.35%, proving my earlier point that just because the code executed doesn't mean I've actually tested all of the behavior.  A safer way to say it is that there is 33.65% of the code that I absolutely _have not tested_ yet, and 66.35% of the code _may_ have been tested.

More of the same type of new tests, this time for `-Qualifier`.  Coverage still at 66.35%.

Another straightforward test, though while writing this, I came across another bit of behavior to add to the "defaults" tests.  If you have a qualified (aka quoted) token, any text between the closing qualifier and the next delimiter is discarded.  For example, passing in a string of `'"Token One"Garbage "Token Two"` results in receiving an result of `@('Token One', 'Token Two)`.  This is a type of malformed input, and apparently that's how I decided to deal with it.  I'm not sure I like that now, but I can change it later.  For now, this is about testing the existing behavior.

Coverage up to 68.27%.

I tested these two together since `-LineDelimiter` only matters if the `-Span` switch is also used.  Nothing too crazy going on here.  Coverage up to 70.19%.
