####Commit [b4e87fbc](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/b4e87fbc9a841fa383fa84fe1992c930d8f835b1)

Here we go!  The `Get-StringToken` function is in the [StringTokens.psm1](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/blob/b4e87fbc9a841fa383fa84fe1992c930d8f835b1/StringTokens.psm1) script module, and [Tester.ps1](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/blob/b4e87fbc9a841fa383fa84fe1992c930d8f835b1/Tester.ps1) (if you can even call that a "test") is demonstration code which was copied and pasted pretty much verbatim onto the TechNet Script Gallery page where this code was uploaded.  Initial observations:

- Tester.ps1 has to go.  It's going to be replaced with a proper suite of unit tests using Pester.  For this, I'll be using the latest Beta version of Pester v3 (currently available from https://github.com/pester/Pester/tree/Beta).  If Pester v3 is released by the time this refactoring log is finished, that link will have changed.
- `Get-StringToken` itself is a single function around 350 lines long, 300 if you ignore the comment-based help.  Once we understand everything that it does and have a suite of tests to ensure its behavior remains consistent, we'll start to break that code up into much smaller, easy to understand functions.
- One thing that the current version of `Get-StringToken` has going for it are comments next to many of the conditional statements.  These will help in understanding what the heck is going in in this 300-line blob of code, but eventually, we're going to get rid of those comments and replace them with code that is so easy to take in at a glance, it doesn't need to be commented anyway.

####Commit [d6f865b1](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/d6f865b19de7006414d2ad9fec6798c3eaad54fb) - Beginning to write Pester tests

Before making any changes to the existing code, I want to have a complete suite of unit tests documenting and verifying its behavior.  I started by reading the Comment-Based Help of `Get-StringToken` and by reading the existing Tester.ps1 script.  While these were not automated tests, they still had valuable example code and documentation of what each parameter of `Get-StringToken` was supposed to accomplish.

Based on this documented behavior, I was able to determine that if you only pass in a string (or array of strings) to Get-StringToken, it should have the following behavior:

- Strings are delimited by tabs and spaces (in addition to line endings)
- Consecutive delimiters should produce an empty token in between each pair.
- Tokens can contain delimiters if they are surrounded with a pair of double quotes.
- If a token does not begin with a double quote, any double quote characters found within the token are just treated as literals.
- Inside a quoted string, you can embed a literal quotation mark by placing two consecutive quotation marks.
- Quoted tokens cannot contain multiple lines.
 
You can see the first few Pester tests in [StringTokens.Tests.ps1](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/blob/d6f865b19de7006414d2ad9fec6798c3eaad54fb/StringTokens.Tests.ps1).  To execute these tests, I use the `Invoke-Pester` command, producing the following output:

```posh

```

I may think of other tests for this "default behavior" context as time goes on, but for now, it's a good start.  Next steps:  look more closely at each of the other parameters to Get-StringToken, and write more tests which verify the output when they're used.  Note that I'm not touching the ugly code at all yet.  I'm not going to do that until I have a complete suite of tests for all of the code.  Speaking of which, here's how I can use Pester's code coverage analysis feature (new to the v3.0 beta) to get an idea of how much progress I'm making:

```posh
Invoke-Pester -CodeCoverage .\StringTokens.psm1

64 percent... not too bad, considering I haven't tested any of the optional parameters to the function yet.  Keep in mind, though, that this just tells me how much code in the module was _executed_ during the tests; it's no guarantee that I've actually written enough assertions to consider all of that code _tested_.

#### Commit [87c85c1b](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/87c85c1b8c1e7ac98f093d364a9277476cb0b290#diff-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e) - Testing the `-Escape` parameter

Starting to write tests around each of the optional parameters; I picked `-Escape` as the lucky first contestant.  According to the documentation, examples, and what dim memory I have of writing this code, I gave the user a couple of options for passing in the list of escape characters.  You could choose to pass in an array (e.g.: `-Escape @('\', '#')`), or a single string containing the characters (or whatever combination of the two.)  Why I felt this was a good idea at the time, I don't know, but now it's part of the public API, and that's how it will stay.  It just means there's more behavior to test.

I also realized that in the "default behavior" tests, I hadn't verified that no characters work as escape characters, other than doubling up the qualifier (quote).  I added a test for this, but it was very slow to run at first (using a full set of 0..65535 for the characters to test), so I limited it to just the basic ASCII range of 0..127.

Not much difference in the code coverage metrics from this; up about another 2% to 66.35.

Not much to see here.  Tests are just about identical to those for the `-Escape` parameter, as `-Delimiter` allows the same options of passing by array or in a single string.  Code coverage remains the same at 66.35%, proving my earlier point that just because the code executed doesn't mean I've actually tested all of the behavior.  A safer way to say it is that there is 33.65% of the code that I absolutely _have not tested_ yet, and 66.35% of the code _may_ have been tested.

More of the same type of new tests, this time for `-Qualifier`.  Coverage still at 66.35%.

#### Commit [5fa24f2b](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/5fa24f2b87cf12411642af0a5a2bc851449a6778#diff-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e) - Testing the `-NoDoubleQualifier` switch

Another straightforward test, though while writing this, I came across another bit of behavior to add to the "defaults" tests.  If you have a qualified (aka quoted) token, any text between the closing qualifier and the next delimiter is discarded.  For example, passing in a string of `'"Token One"Garbage "Token Two"` results in receiving an result of `@('Token One', 'Token Two)`.  This is a type of malformed input, and apparently that's how I decided to deal with it.  I'm not sure I like that now, but I can change it later.  For now, this is about testing the existing behavior.

Coverage up to 68.27%.

I tested these two together since `-LineDelimiter` only matters if the `-Span` switch is also used.  Nothing too crazy going on here.  Coverage up to 70.19%.

#### Commit [dc8b5d65](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/dc8b5d65126d77db9cb9d49d3407cac4d4e41d0a#diff-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e) - Testing the `-IgnoreConsecutiveDelimiters` switch

Not much to see here, small and simple test.  Coverage metric unchanged at 70.19%.

I'm really getting sick of copying and pasting this same loop to test array equality.  I was going to wait to change that until the Pester update to address it is merged in, but I think I'll just add an Assert-ArraysAreEqual function into this test script for now in the next commit.

Much better!  Cleaned up all those annoying duplicated bits with calls to Assert-ArraysAreEqual.  Now to move on with writing more tests.

This is the last of the optional parameters on the list.  Code coverage is up to 93.27%; next step is to take a closer look at the lines that it says I missed, and see if I need to add some more tests around those edges.

The missing commands in the coverage report all had to do with edge cases around encountering the end of a string or an EOL character within a quoted token, with and without the `-GroupLines` switch.  This is a form of malformed input, but something the function handles gracefully by just assuming that the user meant to close the quoted token before the end of the line.

Now we can start to look at the actual code of StringTokens.psm1 and decide how to refactor it.  That's a project for another day, though; it's time for bed.

#### Commit [9d3df736](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/9d3df73601c334dbe599398131a055a803d71548) - Moving state / option variables into a single object

This is looking ahead a bit.  I know that I want to extract methods from the body of `Get-StringToken`, and it will be easier to pass around a single state variable to these methods than it would be to pass around all of the various individual variables.  This also abstracts those details from the `Get-StringToken` function itself, so they can change later without affecting that part fo the code.

Notice that nothing's using the `$parseState` varible yet; in fact, I haven't changed any of the code that would affect a test (and they're all still passing.)  Refactoring should be done in small steps, and sometimes that means adding new code which isn't used yet.

Next steps:  Change references to the various variables initialized in the `begin` block to property references on `$parseState` instead.  Once those are all done, I should be able to delete the rest of the `begin` block (leaving only the call to `New-ParseState`), freeing me up to start to extract out code from the rest of the function easily.

#### Commit [334985df](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/334985df90ae28be887ea79c5109096e751d6317) - Replacing `$delimiters` with `$parseState.Delimiters`

Small, easy change, all tests still work.  Next, I'll remove the `$delimiters` variable initialization code from the `begin` block of `Get-StringToken`.  If I haven't missed anything, that variable should no longer be used anyway, and nothing will miss it.

#### Commit [68bd52fe](https://github.com/dlwyatt/RefactoringPowerShellWithPester/commit/68bd52fe1994da715da71c606237c6cf97599a0d) - Removing the old $delimiters variable

Success:  deleted those 9 lines of code, and all tests still worked.

The next few refactoring steps are going to be more of the same:  Updating a reference to an old variable with a reference to a $parseState property instead, then removing the old variable.  Because writing these log file updates takes much longer than the refactoring itself, and because these steps will all be repeating the same task, I'll combine them into a single commit and log update.  (However, I'll still be running the Pester test script after each change.)
